2. Download or clone the [project repository](https://github.com/udacity/RoboND-Kinematics-Project) into the ***src*** directory of your ROS Workspace.  
3. Experiment with the Preception environment and get familiar with the camera.
4. Launch in [demo mode](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd209/parts/7b2fd2d7-e181-401e-977a-6158c77bf816/modules/8855de3f-2897-46c3-a805-628b5ecf045b/lessons/91d017b1-4493-4522-ad52-04a74a01094c/concepts/ae64bb91-e8c4-44c9-adbe-798e8f688193).
5. Perform Kinematic Analysis for the robot following the [project rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/972/view).
6. Fill in the `segmentation.py` with your Inverse Kinematics code.
